1️⃣ Build the Kafka Streams Transformation Engine
This is the heart of your Kafkaesque system.

✅ Read messages from incoming-events

✅ Extract clientId

✅ Apply transformation using your JSON engine (transformJson(schema, input))

✅ Enrich (optional): e.g. join with user data in a KTable / GlobalKTable

✅ Route to client-a-events, client-b-events, etc.

✅ Optionally store in MongoDB

Would you like me to scaffold this part next?

2️⃣ Dynamic Schema Management (Optional)
Enable the system to dynamically load or update ClientSchema per client.

Store schema per client in DB or Redis

Expose REST endpoints:

POST /api/schema/{clientId} to register/update

Load into ConcurrentHashMap<String, ClientSchema>

Do you want this added now or later?

3️⃣ Monitoring & Observability
Optional but powerful

Add metrics (Micrometer + Prometheus)

Add Kafka topic monitoring (e.g. Redpanda Console, Conduktor)

Log transformation success/fail counts per client

4️⃣ Testing Pipeline End-to-End
Let’s validate your system:

Send data from REST producer

Kafka Streams processes it

MongoDB stores it (if enabled)

Validate in consumer topic or DB
